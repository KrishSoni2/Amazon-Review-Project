This project involves analyzing Amazon product reviews and metadata. The task required downloading and unzipping two JSON files: one containing over 1.2 million product reviews and another with metadata including product descriptions, ASIN IDs, and related products. Using Python, the files were converted into data frames. A random user review was selected to print the user's name and the product's price. The product's description was retrieved, and sentiment analysis was performed to assess user satisfaction. Additionally, each product in the "also bought" list was analyzed, and sentiment scores were compiled. Finally, Matplotlib was used to create a bar graph visualizing the most likely next purchase based on the highest sentiment scores.
